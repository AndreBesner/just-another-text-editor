## Description

This is a simple, web-browser based text editor. It allows the user to type directly into browser, showing how many lines have been typed. The app will dynamically save the entered data anytime the window goes out of focus. This is automatically retrieved the next time the user opens the page. It also allows the user to save the app for later use and creates an icon on their desktop.
